##  best tips to create ats friendly resume
Creating an ATS-friendly resume is essential for senior professionals to pass applicant tracking systems and reach recruiters. 
For those with extensive experience, focus on relevance, quantifiable achievements, and scannable formatting over exhaustive career histories.

### Keyword Optimization
Tailor your resume by incorporating exact keywords, phrases, job titles, and skills from the job description naturally throughout sections like summary, experience, and skills—aim for 70-80% match rate without stuffing.

Prioritize senior-level terms like "strategic leadership," "P&L management," or "digital transformation" from the posting, including both acronyms and full forms (e.g., "Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)").

For senior roles, highlight years of experience upfront in your professional summary, such as "15+ years in executive sales leadership."

### Formatting Essentials
Use a clean, chronological or hybrid format with standard section headings like "Professional Experience," "Education," "Skills," and "Certifications" to ensure ATS parsing.

Stick to simple fonts (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman, 10-12 pt), standard bullet points, left-aligned text, and avoid tables, images, graphics, headers/footers, or columns.

Save as .docx or ATS-compatible PDF (check job posting); limit to 2 pages max, focusing on the last 10-15 years of relevant experience.

### Content for Senior Experience
Lead with a keyword-rich headline and summary showcasing leadership achievements with metrics (e.g., "Drove 30% revenue growth across 5 divisions").

In experience bullets, use action verbs and quantifiable results; reorganize to prioritize job-matching roles first.

List skills prominently with specifics like tools or certifications relevant to the role, avoiding generic lists.​

### Proofing and Testing
Proofread meticulously for errors, as ATS may flag them; test by copying into plain text or using free ATS scanners for compatibility.

Customize per application and get feedback to confirm readability for both machines and humans.

## steps on how to grade a resume for ATS compatibility and job match

Grading a resume for ATS compatibility and job match involves systematic checks using free online tools and manual audits. Aim for an overall score of 80%+ to boost interview chances, focusing on keyword alignment and parseability.

Preparation Steps
Copy the full job description into a text file and identify 15-20 key elements like required skills, job titles, certifications, and metrics.

Upload your resume (DOCX or PDF) to a free ATS checker like Jobscan, Resumly, or Zety.

Paste the job description alongside for a side-by-side match analysis.

Run Automated Scan
Click "analyze" or "scan" to generate a score (0-100) with breakdowns on keyword match, formatting, skills coverage, and parse errors.

Review highlighted issues: missing keywords (aim for 80% match), unreadable sections (e.g., tables), or low readability.

Note weighted factors like keyword placement (summary/experience > elsewhere) and exact phrasing over synonyms.

Manual Grading Criteria
Score keyword match: 40% weight—count job-specific terms (e.g., "Python, Agile") and their frequency in context.

Evaluate formatting (20%): Paste into Notepad; check if structure holds without graphics or columns (100% clean = full points).

Assess job alignment (40%): Verify experience level, skills/tools, and quantifiable achievements mirror the JD (e.g., "10+ years leadership").

Iterate and Finalize
Edit based on feedback (add keywords naturally, fix formatting), re-scan until 80-100%, then test human readability.

Cross-check with plain text view and a second tool for consistency.

## Templates for action verbs to boost ATS scores
Action verbs are crucial for ATS optimization as they signal specific skills and achievements, improving keyword matches when tailored to job descriptions. Use them at the start of bullet points with quantifiable results to boost parseability and scores by 12-15%.

Leadership & Management
Directed, orchestrated, mobilized, spearheaded, championed

Formulated, devised, architected strategic initiatives
​

Maximized ROI, enhanced performance across teams

Technical & Analysis
Engineered, streamlined, optimized systems/processes

Interpreted, synthesized, quantified data insights
​

Forecasted, diagnosed, uncovered trends
​

Sales & Communication
Negotiated, persuaded, articulated key deals

Amplified, boosted revenue by X%
​

Accelerated growth, capitalized opportunities
​

General Achievements
Replace generics like "responsible for" or "helped" with: achieved, attained, decreased costs.

Tailor from the job description's top verbs, ensure past tense for prior roles, and pair with metrics (e.g., "Orchestrated projects increasing leads 22%").
